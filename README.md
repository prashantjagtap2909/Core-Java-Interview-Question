 ### JDK, JRE and JIT
  1.  ####  What's the difference between a JDK and a JRE?

   - JDK (Java Development Kit): Provides the tools for building Java applications, including the JRE, compilers, debuggers, and other development utilities.
    
   - JRE (Java Runtime Environment): Provides the basic environment to run Java programs. It includes the JVM and core Java class libraries.

  2.  ####  What is the role of JIT (Just-In-Time Compiler) in Java?

   - The JIT compiler is part of the JVM. It takes bytecode (the intermediate language Java programs are compiled into) and translates it into machine code specific to your computer's               processor for faster execution.

 3.  #### How is a compiler different from an interpreter?

   - Compiler: Translates source code (human-readable code like Java) into machine code all at once before the program runs. Machine code is specific to the processor and runs directly.
    
   - Interpreter: Translates source code into machine code line by line as the program executes. No need to generate all the code upfront, but it can be slower than a compiler.

 4.  ####  What does the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) do?

   - The JVM is a program that executes bytecode. Bytecode is not specific to any computer architecture, allowing Java programs to run on any machine with a JVM. The JVM translates bytecode into   machine code specific to your processor at runtime.

5.  ####  What's the difference between source code and bytecode?

   - Source code: Human-readable code written in a programming language like Java.
    
   - Bytecode: An intermediate language generated from source code by a Java compiler. Bytecode allows Java programs to run on any computer with a JVM because it's not specific to a particular architecture.
